# bash-ssl-checker-tool
This is a very simple bash script that you could use to gain general information for the SSL certificate of a certain domain name. It is based on the functionality of the popular https://sslshopper.com website, but it's a command line tool.

The script has been tested on CentOS, Ubuntu, Mint and Debian.

Note: You need to have 'openssl' installed.
